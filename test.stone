## A `check` with no arg is equivalent to a `check` with an arg of `true`.
## You can use this as an arbitrary "if-elseif-else" block. Anything on the
## left-hand side that evaluates to `true` will execute the right-hand side
## and then break. If there are no matches, the right-hand side of `_>` will
## be evaluated (as the "default")

## A `check` with an arg evaluates the left-hand expressions like this:
##   - if there is a `?` then it interpolates `bar` there, and it will match
##     only if the expression evaluates to `true`
##   - if there is no `?` then it will match against the value of `bar`, using
##     `bar`'s method `match`, which falls back to `==` if it's not explicitly
##     defined on the callee (an example of the advantage of `match` over `==`
##     here would be checking against regular expressions)
